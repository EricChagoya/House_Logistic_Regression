# House_Logistic_Regression
I have two datasets, older.csv and newer.csv. The difference between the two datasets is that one file
has houses that have been sold before 180 days and the other has houses sold 180 days or after.

log_house.py is where visualize and cleanup the data. I also create a logistic moel of whether or not a house will
be sold before or after 180 days based off a couple of characteristics like the price, location, number of bedrooms/
bathrooms, etc. 
My model is only a bit better than completely guessing.
